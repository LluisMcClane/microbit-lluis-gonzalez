# Harmonic Series 

## Explanation :eyes:

The program displays an harmonic series, which is a mathematic series formed by adding all positive unit fractions based on the amount of times the user presses button A. Button B makes the squence to end, and the the programm displays the sequence after this input.

The user_interact function executes the harmonic_series function for the set of numbers indicated by the amount of times the user presses button A. The harmonic_series function calculates the harmonic series. The numElements function manages when the user_interact and harmonic_series functions are called. The showIcon function displays a diamond icon and the word "Harmonic". Finally, the on_forever function is a loop that runs forever and makes calls to the previous functions.

I have also added a small melody when the user selects the B :notes:
